I'm starting up another solo Ironsworn campaign. I'd like to journal it here, but no promises. Time's pretty tight with a recent addition to the family.

This post will be a session zero of sorts. I'll describe my approach to the game and this blog.

<!-- more -->

Here's some thoughts on this campaign:
- **Goal**. My goal with this campaign is to (a) play more RPGs; (b) internalise Ironsworn rules; and (c) destress through a hobby I love
- **Style**. I want to focus on the gameplay, not use this as a writing exercise. I'll keep the narrative pretty lean and keep the spotlight on the mechanics
- **Schedule**. I'll try to keep a consistent schedule. If I fail to keep to a schedule, no stress. It's hobby time, which is pretty low on the pecking order of time

I might come back and add to the above later on.

Next up, I'll go through Ironsworn's worldbuilding exercise to prep the setting.
