For my solo Ironsworn game, I downloaded the [official character sheet](https://www.ironswornrpg.com/downloads), printed it out on some nice paper and envisioned a character outside of the usual rogue archetype I like.

I started off by allocating the standard stat array:

- **Edge** 1
- **Heart** 2
- **Iron** 2
- **Shadow** 1
- **Wits** 3

I rolled on the Ironlander name table and got *Kynan*.

I figure Kynan (he/him) is a woodworker, so I picked some assets to suit:

- **Wright** (specialty: woodwork). This asset will let Kynan to craft and repair wooden items with a +1 to the action die. He'll also take +1 to momentum on a hit.
- **Sunderer**. If Kynan wields an axe, I'll be able to exchange -1 momentum for a +1 harm on a hit (*Strike* and *Clash* moves only).
- **Leech**. Last time we found out that magic in the Ironlands is rare and dangerous. It would be cool if Kynan knows a ritual and keeps this more or less a secret. Leech lets him mark his hands or weapon with a blood rune and roll +iron. On a strong hit, he'll get a one-time bonus when inflicting harm. Same for weak hit, but it'll leave him with a debility until the rune's thirst is quenched. Kynan is a spooky lumberjack.

As a woodworker, Kynan likely lives south of the Veiled Mountains. This gives me an idea for his background vow: to travel beyond the Shattered Wastes (an inhospitable glacier beyond the Veiled Mountains and the northermost region of the Ironlands).

For bonds, I wanted Kynan to share a bond with his settlement so I rolled a settlement name of *Stonetower*. His other bonds are with *Sidan* (Kynan's cousin; I rolled the character descriptor of *insightful*) and Qamar (Kynan's *violent* apprentice).

I rolled on the settlement trouble oracle and got *in the crossfire*. I couldn't think of a solid take on this, so I reversed the number and got *production halts*. I can work with that.

The village of Stonetower sits between the Havens and the Sunken Lands. A group of villagers, including my cousin Sidan's husband, have ventured into the Sunken Lands to gather iron bog and failed to return. Sidan has asked me to investigate her husband's disappearance.

Next time, we'll make our first move and swear an iron vow to help Sidan.
