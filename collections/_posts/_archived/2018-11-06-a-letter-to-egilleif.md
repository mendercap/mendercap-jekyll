Greetings, Egilleif,

I hope this letter finds you well.

My name is Mosul, though you may know me by a Skulde name. Mozes. A name I took to fit in. The same name that my son threw at me in anger mere days before he left for the Ironlands.

<!-- more -->

My family has always spoken highly of you. I am told that few honour our gods with such faith and power. Time and again I have heard of your skill as an Augur, akin to a shepherd directing her flock with an able hand.

So I write to ask of you a favour. My son, Faida, is missing. He left the mainland for the Ironlands two months ago. It was his aunt who convinced him to make the voyage with her. To spite me for serving the invaders who took her sister's life.

A friend saw my grief and offered me passage to the Ironlands. After a month at sea, and by Turasætha's grace, I set foot on the Barrier Islands.

You may have guessed at the favour I would ask of you. I have managed to barter for the services of a raven keeper in the fishing town of Fargrave in hope that you may lend your Augury to my quest.

For I swear on this iron torque: I will find my son. To ask forgiveness. To take him home. And should he say no, to make a new home, as close as he would let me.

_Background vow (extreme): I will find my son and ask forgiveness._

—Mosul
