The following is an excerpt from the dialogue between Mosul and Klem, the raven keeper of Fargrave.

"The letter I received yesterday—do you remember the Augur I told you about?"

"Egilleif."

"Dead. Butchered. Her son sent the missive in her stead. He wishes luck but doesn't possess his mother's gift."

<!-- more -->

"Have you any idea where your son may be?"

"No. None. The Augur was my only lead."

"And you've come to ask if I know of another?"

I nodded.

Klem looked away. His eyes settled on his ravens.

_Swear an iron vow (formidable): I will find another Augur, weak hit_

"I do, but he lives off the island."

"So I'll find a boat."

"Tell me, how much do you know about the lord of this island?"

"Traevor? His housecarls swagger around like the morning after a spring festival. Is he your Augur?"

"No. Like I said, this man, Kanno, doesn't live in Fargrave. But to reach him, you'd have to leave the island. Lord Traevor's ordered all ships remain on this island until a certain trinket of his turns up. Preferrably together with the head of its thief."

I whistled through my teeth.

"What about the fishermen?"

"Traevor's housecarls control the granary. What _about_ the fishermen?"

"And this trinket?"

"A crown!"

Klem barked with laughter.

"A seamstress's son, soon to be our king. Listen, if you want off this island, visit the docks and start talking to the people. There should be more than a few souls willing to brave an escape before Traevor starves us all."

"What about you, Klem? With the place on lockdown, you and your birds are about the only thread we have to the other islands. It seems likely this thief would try to contact an accomplice."

_Compel (+heart, +bond): weak hit_

The unspoken question brought the conversation to a standstill.

"Alright. If we can put an end to this, I'll do it. But I want you to do something too."

_Oracle (action: 37—hunt; theme: 4—ally)_

"Sure, ask away."

"Someone's been stealing my ravens. For the past three days, I've woken up to another bird missing from its cage. Help me stop this while I still have a business to run."

"I'll catch your thief, and you catch mine."
